# terraform_challenge2
A challenge by my instructor to create a Kubernetes cluster with Azure Kubernetes Service using Terraform

Found the step by step solution on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/create-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks
Made some tweaks on the code to run it successfully
